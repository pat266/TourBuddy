Are you . . . everyone?

We reassess and update this list every couple of years; this time around, weâ\\x80\\x99ve added the option to filter the results by what youâ\\x80\\x99re seeking, whether itâ\\x80\\x99s outdoor seating, an unusual wine list, or a specific regional cuisine. (Note that this required a few judgment calls on our partâ\\x80\\x94many of these spots serve beer and cocktails, for instance, but clicking the â\\x80\\x9cBeerâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cCocktailsâ\\x80\\x9d buttons below will bring up restaurants with offerings we think are especially ambitious or noteworthy.) Weâ\\x80\\x99ll continue making minor adjustments as restaurants close or move, but in the meantime, we hope youâ\\x80\\x99ll have fun digging through this listâ\\x80\\x94and then dining your way across the city.Edited by Sam WorleyContributions from Mike Jordan and Christiane LauterbachPhotograph above by Bailey Garrot 1 Shares 1 Restaurants keyboard_arrow_down Arepa Mia Argosy Aria Bacchanalia Banshee Bastone Biggerstaff Birrieria Landeros BoccaLupo Bon Ton Bread & Butterfly Buena Gente Cuban Bakery Chai Pani The Chastain Che Butter Jonez Com Ga Houston Daily Chew Deer & the Dove Empire State South Feedel Bistro Fishmonger Food Terminal Fox Bros.

Argosy aims in many directions and scores a surprising number of hits, with wood-fired pizzas, ham-hock collards and cornbread, togarashi-spiced popcorn, vegan cold-cut sandwiches, and a double burger with caramelized onions and American cheese. Ruby red and golden beets, candied walnuts, meyer lemon yogurtPhotograph by Caroline C. KilgoreAriaBuckhead490 East Paces Ferry Road NE aria-atl.com 404-233-7673 @ariaatlantaOpening in 2000 in a vaguely rococo little building with a charming courtyard, Aria has grown into the very picture of a beloved Atlanta restaurant. Buffalo, New York, native Gerry Klaskala is a chefâ\\x80\\x99s chef, not exactly conservative but concerned less with the latest trends than he is with maintaining the gentle, enduring flavors of his cookingâ\\x80\\x94slow-braised Berkshire pork with parmesan polenta, butter-poached lobster, duck breast with honey spiceâ\\x80\\x94and the hospitality for which his restaurant is known. If you value a well-set table, there arenâ\\x80\\x99t many left; if you value a delicious burger, donâ\\x80\\x99t miss Klaskalaâ\\x80\\x99s (served in Ariaâ\\x80\\x99s romantic lounge but not in its dining room). Longtime pastry chef Kathryn King is nearly as famous as her boss; try her lemon pound cake with vanilla-roasted plums. Photograph by Bailey GarrotBacchanaliaBlandtown1460 Ellsworth Industrial Boulevard starprovisions.com/bacchanalia 404-365-0410 @starprovisionsOpening in 1993 in a charming Buckhead cottage, the first iteration of Anne Quatrano and Clifford Harrisonâ\\x80\\x99s hugely influential Atlanta restaurant brought much joy to a city where the prevailing style left little room for fresh, local ingredients. In 1999, a move to a then semi-industrial stretch of Howell Mill Road propelled the restaurant into the world of true fine dining, where its proprietors earned a well-deserved James Beard Award. Diners en route to their tables walked first through Star Provisionsâ\\x80\\x94the most advanced combination of butcher, seafood counter, cheesemonger, bakery, wine store, and gift shopâ\\x80\\x94already in a daze of appreciation. This was, in effect, Bacchanaliaâ\\x80\\x99s pantry. The married couple behind it, both chefs, often trucked in produce from their family farm in Cartersville to anchor a menu of sensible sophistication.Then, Bacchanalia moved a third time, one mile west into a sort of luxury roadhouse on Ellsworth Industrial Boulevardâ\\x80\\x94losing none of its meaning or excellence along the way. On a four-course prix-fixe menu, some dishes need never change: The famous crab fritters with Thai essence, citrus, and avocado and the unctuous steak tartare with sesame, daikon, and kimchi have earned their place in the pantheon. Extras such as caviar service, an exquisitely composed plateau de fruits de mer, and a cheese cart nonpareil enhance a restaurant whose seasonal interpretations of familiar proteins always remind me that Georgia is one of the great agricultural states. Wine pairings are advisable and suave service is a given. There remain, at Bacchanalia, no false steps. â\\x80\\x94CL Bar managers Faielle Stocco (left) and Katie McDonald prepare a Stately HagPhotograph by Iain BagwellBansheeEast Atlanta Village1271 Glenwood Avenue SE banshee-atl.com 470-428-2034 @banshee_eavYour humble correspondent once witnessed the following scene on the dim-lit patio here: a diner enjoying a first-course salad (strawberries, cucumber, fennel, yogurt, and sumac, with briny little chunks of olive scattered around) so immensely that, when it came time to order the second course, she just opted for another plate of the same damn thing. In eclectic EAV, Banshee remains sui generis: warm, funky, sophisticated, and ever-changing, with chef Nolan Wynn spinning seasonal produce into culinary goldâ\\x80\\x94Parisian gnocchi with lamb merguez and pea pesto, grilled pork with glazed eggplant, peach kosho, and miso vinaigrette. The quality of the food (and creativity of the cocktails) is one unchanging element; the other is a starter of pepperoni butter, served to diners with frybread but so popular that the restaurant now sells it by the pint. Pat PascarellaPhotograph by Martha WilliamsBastoneWestside887 Howell Mill Road NW bastoneatlanta.com 404-252-6699 @bastoneatlThe latest from Pat Pascarella (White Bull, Grana) is built on cheese: He bills this buzzy Westside eatery as a â\\x80\\x9cmozzarella barâ\\x80\\x9d and offers a generous handful of varieties for sampling, from earthy mozzarella di bufala to fattâ\\x80\\x99 a manoâ\\x80\\x94a pleasingly chewy version pulled by hand at a dedicated station behind the Bastone bar. They can be enjoyed as part of a mozz flight, and/or with salumi, and/or with focaccia, taralli, little dishes of olivesâ\\x80\\x94and definitely with wine and cocktails, and as a forerunner to some of the more substantial handmade pastas on the menu. This isnâ\\x80\\x99t a quiet, candlelit Italian restaurantâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s bustling and light-filled, with a personality as big as its flavors. Under chef Davis King, Biggerstaff serves smart, vegetable-forward pub food, such as a magical platter of pickles.Photograph by Martha WilliamsBiggerstaffOld Fourth Ward537 Edgewood Avenue SE biggerstaffbrewing.com 404-796-9919 @biggerstaffbrewingWith Slutty Vegan at one end and Staplehouse at the other, the stretch of Edgewood between Boulevard and Howell is shaping up into a regular restaurant rowâ\\x80\\x94and this brewpub is one of its finest recent additions. Even if the beer were lousy, a trip would be in order just to dig into chef Davis Kingâ\\x80\\x99s hearty, veg-forward menu, which feels like the next generation of bar food: raw oysters, smart salads, housemade pimento cheese, fries with garlic aioli, and a few more substantial sandwiches and dinner plates that change with the seasons. And, to be clear, the beersâ\\x80\\x94a few clean-tasting pale ales and IPAs, several sours, various rotating optionsâ\\x80\\x94are the opposite of lousy. Other perks: a daytime coffee bar and one of the chillest patios around. Photograph by Martha WilliamsBirrieria LanderosDuluth2400 Satellite Boulevard birria.ga 678-373-3657 @birrialandAtlanta dinersâ\\x80\\x99 passion for birria has not really abated, with the spicy Mexican stewed meat available around town in forms more traditional (birria tacos, quesabirria) and less (birria ramen, birria pizza). One of the most exciting renditions to hit the scene recently is the birria de borrego at this family-run joint: dissolvingly tender lamb, served in a velvety, lightly spiced tomato broth and based on a recipe that an earlier generation of Landeroses served at a restaurant in the Mexican state of Aguascaliente. The heirloom preparation is nothing short of stunning; various other dishes, including weekends-only menudo, get high marks, too. Black spaghetti with red shrimpPhotograph by Andrew Thomas LeeBoccaLupoInman Park753 Edgewood Avenue NE boccalupoatl.com 404-577-2332 @boccalupoatlThe name comes from the Italian in bocca al lupoâ\\x80\\x94literally â\\x80\\x9cin the wolfâ\\x80\\x99s mouth,â\\x80\\x9d but its original use has to do with a wish for good luck ahead of a performance, similar to â\\x80\\x9cbreak a leg.â\\x80\\x9d Luck, though, isnâ\\x80\\x99t really required when you pay a visit to this idiosyncratic little restaurant, tucked into a shady street corner, where certainties prevail: chef Bruce Logueâ\\x80\\x99s peerless pastas (black spaghetti with hot Calabrese sausage, red shrimp, and scallions; a famous 20-yolk tagliatelle with mushrooms, kale kimchi, and butter) and inspired antipasti, grown-up cocktails mixed behind a funky bar, and the happy, relaxed atmosphere of a perfect neighborhood joint.

Of particular note: blackened catfish that you can get in a banh mi or over a rice bowl with pickled veg and crispy shallots, boiled seafood by the pound, spicy jicama and papaya salad, and a Nashville hot poâ\\x80\\x99boy with your choice of filling (a fried-oyster option will convert even the most recalcitrant fried-oyster skeptic). A late-night stop for local industry folks, Bon Ton is as much a drinking place as it is an eating place, so donâ\\x80\\x99t skip the hurricanesâ\\x80\\x94or bartender Baylee Hopingsâ\\x80\\x99s more adventuresome flights of fancyâ\\x80\\x94either.

The endless banter between Rhasaan and his wife, Detric Fox-Quinlan, aka Bae Butter Jonezâ\\x80\\x94she typically runs the registerâ\\x80\\x94is half the fun.Com Ga HoustonDuluth3350 Steve Reynolds Boulevard comgahoustonduluth.com 678-691-3143 @comgahoustonThis place is named after the dish it specializes in, a Vietnamese relative of Hainanese chicken rice: skin-on chicken, poached delicately in chicken broth and served cold over rice with a panoply of accoutrementsâ\\x80\\x94various veg and pickled cabbage, onion oil and ginger and Vietnamese coriander leaves, served with ginger sauce and a cup of chicken broth on the side. Itâ\\x80\\x99s splendid, but just the beginning of owner Khoa Doâ\\x80\\x99s bird-centric menu: Thereâ\\x80\\x99s also chicken or duck congee with cubes of pork blood, noodle soups and chicken pho, and magnificent salads built on cabbage or banana blossoms and featuring a whole landscape of torn chicken, herbs, and crispy bits of fried shallot. Julia Kesler ImermanPhotograph by Bailey GarrotDaily ChewPiedmont/Morningside2127 Liddell Drive NE dailychewatl.com 404-600-4155 @dailychewatlJulia Kesler Imerman calls her adorable spot off Cheshire Bridge Road a â\\x80\\x9cholisticâ\\x80\\x9d cafeâ\\x80\\x94I call it a joyous refuge from the vicissitudes of everyday life. Born Jewish in South Africa and raised in Atlanta, the young owner is a proponent of intuitive or mindful eating. Not denying the body what it craves is her philosophy, so on her daily menus, you can find French fries and latkesâ\\x80\\x94in addition to things like rotisserie chicken (or cauliflower), salmon pitas with lemony labneh, shakshuka, and â\\x80\\x9cbrekkie bowlsâ\\x80\\x9d with quinoa, avocado, and soft-boiled eggs.Thereâ\\x80\\x99s more to this tiny whitewashed building than meets the eye. Your first impressionÂ is of a calm respite with two distinct zones: one set up like a living room with books to read and comfy rugs to muffle the sounds; the other more commercial but still peaceful and communal, with a counter for ordering and a handful of grab-and-go items. But in the back, thereâ\\x80\\x99s also a large production facility, where Imermanâ\\x80\\x99s staff assembles the above-mentioned dishes in addition to distinctive shelf-stable products sold on the premises as well as in local groceries: cumin-scented cauliflower Bolognese, various soups and dressings. I find her combination of physical and mental nourishment irresistible, and the obvious success of this young business gives me faith thatâ\\x80\\x94given enough moxie and goodwillâ\\x80\\x94the good can triumph over the mediocre. â\\x80\\x94CL Coffee-dusted venison at the Deer and the DovePhotograph by Martha WilliamsDeer & the DoveDecatur155 Sycamore Street deerdove.com 404-748-4617 @thedeerandthedoveThree years after opening, Terry Kovalâ\\x80\\x99s casually elegant celebration of our regional foodshed is firing on all cylinders: soulful entrees from the familiar (beef burger with thyme aioli and foraged chanterelles, whole trout over farro verde) to the literal deep cuts (sweetbreads au poivre, beef-heart pastrami with beet and potato rosti); vegetables that get at least as much love in the kitchen (Kovalâ\\x80\\x99s ever-changing Harvest Plate doubles as a work of art); cocktails that also make thoughtful use of seasonal and foraged ingredients; gorgeous desserts; and, if that werenâ\\x80\\x99t enough, a daytime auxiliary cafe, B-Side, that serves a mean wood-fired bagel.

In 2010, he added an outpost in Atlanta thatâ\\x80\\x99s still going strong, with its wonderful terrace with Adirondack chairs and bocce court, its early happy hour (itâ\\x80\\x99s three oâ\\x80\\x99clock somewhere . . .), and, of course, its consistently excellent prix fixe menus, ever changing and filled with careful studies of regional ingredients: filet beans with tomato concassÃ©, glazed pork belly over DaySpring Farms grits. It might be good to get your reservations in now: Over the summer, Acheson put the restaurant up for sale.Feedel BistroNorth Druid Hills3125 Briarcliff Road NE feedelbistro.com 404-963-2905 @feedelbistroSiblings Tamar Telahun and Simon Gebru are behind this stylish eatery, which opened in 2018 and demonstrated that the crowded corner of Clairmont and Briarcliff could profitably benefit from yet another East African restaurant; in 2022, Feedel further distinguished itself from the competition (venerable Desta across the street, Bahel right next door) when it announced a new menu with an enhanced focus on vegetarian, vegan, and pescatarian dishes. That includes the wonderfully spiced lentils and split peas youâ\\x80\\x99d find at any other place serving Ethiopian or Eritrean cuisine (already very vegan-friendly), in addition to specialty creations like tibsâ\\x80\\x94traditionally a sauteed-meat dish, made instead with tofu, mushrooms, or chickpeasâ\\x80\\x94and a show-stopping whole branzino.FishmongerPoncey-Highland674 North Highland Avenue678-705-9538 @atlantafishmongerFrom 8Arm (RIP) impresarios Nhan Le and Skip Engelbrecht and chef Bradford Forsblom, this jewel box of a storefront has the potential to be many things to many people: a lunchtime destination for a bowl of chowder and one of the cityâ\\x80\\x99s best new sandwiches (a blackened grouper thatâ\\x80\\x99ll knock your socks off); a retail market with superfresh cuts of fish you can take home and prepare yourself; and a BYOB raw bar serving immaculately prepared oysters, crudo, shrimp cocktail, and more, to be enjoyed in the open air on a few charming sidewalk tables. A second location has opened in Kirkwood.

The single exception: this hip, roomy BuHi staple, where chef Amy Wongâ\\x80\\x99s voluminous menu reflects the cuisine of Malaysia, which itself combines a vast array of influences, from Indian to Hakka Chinese and beyond. So: roti canai with curry spare ribs, curry laksa chicken soup, Hainanese chicken rice, garlic noodles, Sichuan pig ears? Hereâ\\x80\\x99s your hookup for all that and much more. Wong and partner Howie Ewe have since added Westside, Sandy Springs, and Alpharetta outposts. Pulled pork, sliced brisket, Brunswick stew, and collard greensPhotograph by Andrew Thomas LeeFox Bros. Bar-B-QCandler Park1238 DeKalb Avenue foxbrosbbq.com 404-577-4030 @foxbrosbarbqThe fact that this roadhouse-style joint sits next to the absolute worst stretch of DeKalb Avenue and still attracts a stampede of diners is testament to just how good Jonathan and Justin Foxâ\\x80\\x99s barbecue really isâ\\x80\\x94or maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s the other way around, and the endless flow in and out of the parking lot is what turned this patch of DeKalb into the equivalent of a dirt road after heavy flooding. Regardless, the pinnacle of the twin brothersâ\\x80\\x99 Texas barbecue is their brisketâ\\x80\\x94sliced or chopped, with just the right amount of smokiness: judicious but not overwhelmingâ\\x80\\x94but donâ\\x80\\x99t overlook the housemade jalapeÃ±o-cheddar sausages, smoked wings, or fun Lone Starâ\\x80\\x93style sides like Frito pie. This is the flagship; Fox Bros. also has locations at Armour Yards and Chattahoochee Food Works.

Start with compact New Yorkâ\\x80\\x93style bagels that strike a balance between nostalgic and slightly dressed-up: On an open-faced sandwich called the Avenue A, for instance, chunks of grapefruit and avocado offer a fresh and very pretty addition to the tried-and-true combo of nova smoked salmon, red onion, and dill. Towering sandwiches make hearty lunchesâ\\x80\\x94whether you choose a corned-beef Reuben or a beguiling vegetarian version, made with thinly sliced smoked beetsâ\\x80\\x94and thereâ\\x80\\x99s something for the in-between times, too, in a bakery and coffee bar that features black-and-white cookies, rugelach, and much more.

Two young chefs, Eric Brooks and Jacob Armando, are behind it, offering a tightly curated, seasonally driven Italian menu with dishes like fried polenta cake with creme fraiche and caviar, brassicas cooked over a yakitori grill and seasoned with Calabrian chilis, and artfully plated housemade pastas and classic preparations like chicken Milanese. Replacing Nicholas Stinsonâ\\x80\\x99s beloved Gato, Gigiâ\\x80\\x99s promises to be just as integral to the fabric of the neighborhood.

The setup requires some explanation: As they finish a batch of dishes, cooks roam the dining room, presenting them dim sumâ\\x80\\x93style to diners who then say yea or nay; diners may also engage a roving bar cart to have cocktails made tableside.
